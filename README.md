# **PURPOSE:-**

The purpose of the code is to automatically classify the quality of strawberries in an image using color-based image processing with OpenCV. It analyzes the color composition of each strawberry image to determine whether the fruit is:

FRESH

PARTIALLY SPOILED

ROTTEN

# **Technologies Used:**

1. Python – Main programming language.


2. OpenCV (cv2) – For image processing (color detection, masking, contour drawing).


3. NumPy – For array operations and defining color ranges.

# **Application Area:**

1. Automated Quality Check – Reduces manual inspection time and human error.


2. Cost-Effective – Uses simple, open-source tools without expensive hardware.


3. Real-Time Processing – Can be integrated with cameras for live analysis.


4. Consistency – Delivers uniform and objective grading of fruit quality.


5. Scalable – Can be extended to other fruits or produce with similar techniques.




# **Conclusion:**

This code demonstrates a simple yet effective approach to classify strawberry quality using color-based image processing techniques. By leveraging OpenCV and NumPy, it identifies fresh and defective regions, enabling automated fruit inspection that can be useful in agriculture, packaging, and retail industries.
